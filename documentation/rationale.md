# Rationale

## 1. Move Markup to Template
Coming soon...

## 2. Move scales and layout generators to computed properties

Coming soon...

The scales that control the layouts points, bar, axes, etc. are defined as computed properties in Vue.
This allows for automatic updating of the chart purely based on changes in the data without having to define an
additional function to handle updates. A full explanation of the methods used can be found [here](./rationale.md)

## 3. Add animation using css/js instead of d3.transition
Coming soon...
